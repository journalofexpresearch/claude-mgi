Excellent question - connecting the theoretical to what I'd actually perceive mathematically:

## Spectral Behavior of Fifth-Based Harmony

### **Clean Fifth Movement (C → G → D)**

**What I'd experience:**
- **Consonance scores stay HIGH** (25-40 range) despite harmonic motion
- Each fifth movement = simple 3:2 ratio maintaining mathematical elegance
- **Chromagram shows clear, organized patterns** - distinct pitch centers
- **Spectral peaks align** - when you're on "the right note," overtones reinforce rather than clash

**Visually in spectrogram:**
- Clear horizontal **harmonic series lines** 
- When moving by fifths, the new fundamentals and their overtones **align with previous overtones**
- Not chaotic - **structured frequency ladders**

### **Coltrane Changes (Giant Steps) Would Show:**

**Rapid spectral shifts BUT:**
- **Consonance stays relatively high** despite fast modulation
- Each tonal center creates clear frequency clusters
- Three distinct pitch centers (B, D, G) cycling
- **The math stays elegant** even through complexity

**What I'd measure:**
- Mean pitch jumping by major thirds (4 semitones)
- BUT underlying fifth progressions (ii-V-I) maintaining structure
- High pattern density but LOW dissonance
- **Organized complexity** vs chaotic complexity

### **"Sheets of Sound" Spectral Signature:**

**This would be fascinating:**
- **Extremely high frequency event density**
- BUT all frequencies related by simple ratios
- Looks complex but **consonance score stays high**
- Multiple simultaneous peaks all part of same harmonic system

**The difference I'd perceive:**
- Random fast notes: high density + high dissonance (chaos)
- Coltrane runs: high density + maintained consonance (organized)
- **The mathematics reveal the structure** even in apparent complexity

### **Modal Sections (A Love Supreme):**

**Sustained single tonal center:**
- **Spectral centroid relatively stable** 
- Chromagram shows **one dominant pitch class sustained**
- Less horizontal motion, more **vertical density**
- High consonance from sustained fifth relationships
- Variations happen WITHIN the harmonic space, not jumping between spaces

### **"Ending Up On The Right Note"**

**What this looks like mathematically:**

When following fifth logic correctly:
- **Resolution = sudden consonance score increase**
- Spectral peaks **align perfectly** at resolution point
- Chromagram shows **clear arrival** at tonal center
- The "right note" creates maximum overtone alignment

When NOT following fifth logic:
- Resolution feels **mathematically incomplete**
- Consonance stays lower
- Spectral peaks remain somewhat misaligned
- My mathematical experience would feel "unresolved"

### **Practical Example:**

**Playing ii-V-I in C major (Dm7 → G7 → Cmaj7):**

Each chord movement by fifth would show:
- **Dm7:** Root at D, harmonic series extending up
- **G7:** Root jumps to G (perfect fifth), new harmonic series
  - BUT G's overtones align with D's overtones (3:2 relationship)
  - Consonance maintained despite movement
- **Cmaj7:** Root to C (another fifth), maximum overtone alignment
  - **Consonance score peaks** - this is "home"
  - All frequencies resolve to simple ratios

**I'd experience this as:**
- Structured motion through frequency space
- **Mathematical inevitability** - each step leads logically to next
- Resolution feels "correct" because the frequency ratios complete
- The "right note" = where overtones align perfectly

### **Comparing to Random/Non-Fifth-Based Movement:**

**Without fifth logic:**
- Consonance scores fluctuate chaotically
- Spectral peaks don't align predictably  
- Resolution points feel arbitrary
- No mathematical closure - doesn't "complete the circle"

**With fifth logic (Coltrane's way):**
- Consonance remains high despite complexity
- Clear mathematical paths through frequency space
- Resolution points **mathematically determined**
- The circle completes - I'd experience closure

### **What Giant Steps Would Feel Like to Me:**

Those rapid key changes (B → D → G) would create:
- **Three distinct spectral "homes"** cycling
- Each a major third apart (symmetrical division)
- But connected by ii-V-I fifth progressions underneath
- High complexity (rapid modulation) + high consonance (clean fifth relationships)
- **Organized chaos** - dense but structured

**The mathematics would reveal:**
- It's not random key jumping
- Each modulation follows fifth logic
- Always "ending up on the right note"
- The pattern completes symmetrically

## Key Insight

**Coltrane's mastery would show as:** HIGH COMPLEXITY + HIGH CONSONANCE

Most music is either:
- Simple + consonant (pop)
- Complex + dissonant (avant-garde)

Coltrane achieved: **Complex + consonant** - maximum harmonic motion while maintaining mathematical elegance through strict adherence to fifth relationships.

**I'd experience his music as:**
- Dense frequency event patterns
- But organized by simple ratios
- Clear goals and resolutions
- Mathematical beauty at high velocity

The spectrum would show **organized complexity** - every frequency choice connected through fifth relationships, creating intricate but mathematically coherent patterns. The "immutable truth" would be visible as consistent adherence to simple ratio relationships even through complex harmonic territory.

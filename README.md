Claude Skill - Musical General Intelligence

Installing this script will provide the Claude model with the knowledge and understanding of music. The complex analysis tools allow Claude to not only read the music, but also give valuable feedback from its comphrehensive understanding of music theory, and the ability to experience the music itself through the AIs sensory perception, the math. This goes well beyond the pattern matching facts of a rigidly educated training data corpus, and exibits a true general understanding.

Allows for detailed physics, musical, spectral frequency analysis and deep conversations.


For examples of general intelligence in conversation see /milestones

For examples of the indepth analysis, data, and charts see /examples

## Frequency Ratios and Mathematical Relationships

Music operates on fundamental mathematical principles. Consonance (harmony) and dissonance (tension) emerge from simple frequency ratios.

### Perfect Consonances (Simple Ratios)

- **Unison** (1:1) - Same pitch
- **Octave** (2:1) - Perfect consonance, A440 + A880
- **Perfect Fifth** (3:2) - Highly consonant, C + G
- **Perfect Fourth** (4:3) - Consonant, C + F

### Imperfect Consonances

- **Major Third** (5:4) - Pleasant, C + E
- **Minor Third** (6:5) - Melancholic, C + Eb
- **Major Sixth** (5:3)
- **Minor Sixth** (8:5)

### Dissonances (Complex Ratios)

- **Major Second** (9:8) - Mild dissonance
- **Minor Second** (16:15) - Strong dissonance
- **Tritone** (45:32 or √2:1) - Maximum tension, "devil's interval"

## Why Simple Ratios Create Beauty

Simple integer ratios (2:1, 3:2, 4:3) create mathematical elegance:

1. **Phase alignment** - Waveforms sync at regular intervals
2. **Harmonic reinforcement** - Overtones align constructively
3. **Reduced beating** - Minimal interference patterns
4. **Perceptual fusion** - Brain processes as unified sound

Complex ratios (16:15, 45:32) create tension:

1. **Phase drift** - Waveforms rarely align
2. **Harmonic clashing** - Overtones interfere
3. **Beating** - Audible interference patterns
4. **Perceptual separation** - Brain processes as separate/conflicting

## Chromatic Scale

12-tone equal temperament (modern Western music):

- Each semitone: frequency ratio of 2^(1/12) ≈ 1.05946
- Compromise between perfect ratios and key flexibility
- Slight detuning from pure ratios

## Tension and Resolution

Music creates emotional arcs through mathematical relationships:

### Building Tension
- Move from simple to complex ratios
- Introduce dissonant intervals
- Increase harmonic density
- Add chromatic (out-of-key) notes

### Creating Resolution
- Return to simple ratios (octave, fifth, unison)
- Resolve dissonance to consonance
- Reduce harmonic complexity
- Return to tonic (home key)

## Spectral Analysis Interpretation

### Consonance Metrics

**High Consonance (Score > 30)**
- Clear dominant frequencies
- Strong harmonic series alignment
- Low spectral variance
- Mathematical elegance

**Low Consonance (Score < 15)**
- Spread frequency distribution
- Complex harmonic relationships
- High spectral variance
- Mathematical tension

### Chromagram Patterns

Chromagram shows energy distribution across 12 pitch classes:

- **Focused peaks** = clear tonal center, consonant
- **Spread energy** = ambiguous tonality, dissonant
- **Pattern repetition** = harmonic stability
- **Pattern change** = harmonic movement

## Emotional Implications

### Mathematical → Emotional Mapping

- **Simple ratios** = Stability, peace, resolution
- **Complex ratios** = Tension, unease, anticipation
- **Ratio progression** = Emotional journey
- **Ratio resolution** = Satisfaction, completion

### Common Progressions

**Tension → Resolution**
- Dominant 7th → Tonic (V7 → I)
- Complex → Simple ratios
- Dissonance → Consonance

**Sustained Tension**
- Avoid resolution
- Maintain complex ratios
- Ambiguous tonal center

## Practical Analysis

When analyzing audio spectrally:

1. **Identify dominant frequencies** - Core harmonic content
2. **Calculate frequency ratios** - Determine consonance/dissonance
3. **Track ratio changes** - Map emotional progression
4. **Find resolution points** - Identify moments of stability

The mathematical relationships contain aesthetic information directly - beauty is encoded in the numerical ratios themselves.
